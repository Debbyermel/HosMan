##We will develop a hospital patient bed and doctor availability portal!
As per our study there is only 1 bed/ 1000 patients in our country.
What the basic idea suggest is that every time a bed gets occupied out site should show the remaining numbers of the bed. So that a person who is ill should directly reach to the hospital where the beds are available. 
By this we can save many lives which we loose just because hospital denies beds and patients are roaming helpless in the city.
